<h2 class="not-prose">Conclusions</h2>
<h4 class="not-prose">Features That Matter</h4>
<p>
    The researchers have noticed that upon using machine learning and linear regression, as well as looking into
    correlations between each feature, that the occupancy of hospital beds can affect the injury rates of road-related
    incident victims across all injury types (minor, serious, fatal). The vacancy of hospital beds, which was intriguing
    as that would mean the amount of hospital beds, indifferent to whether or not they're occupied, can be attributed to
    different road injury types.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, some medical equipment also proved to be worth looking into. These were namely the two main types of
    masks used during the COVID-19 pandemic, which are surgical and N95 masks, and medical ventilation machines/units.
    These equipment may prove vital in reducing road-related incident fatalities in the near future. This might hint at
    the possibility of needing more equipment for the near future, especially when hospitals are tending to a certain
    sickness at the time.
</p>
<p>
    Interestingly, no features under the medical staff dataset were deemed to be related to road-related incidents. For
    every injury type, bed occupancy and equipment availability proved to be more influencing than hospital staff
    availability. This may mean that the count of hospital staff is sufficient for aiding road victims.
</p>

<h4 class="not-prose">Looking Forward</h4>
<p>
    The absence of the medical staff in the predictors may signify a need to focus more on supplying hospital resources
    rather than hiring more people. This indicates that medical staff quantity, and availability in general, is not the
    main factor behind road-related injuries and fatalities. Hiring more people isn't the solution.
</p>
<p>
    ICU bed occupancy is a major predictor worth considering and looking into, as it is present in all three injury
    types' list of predictors. This may hint at the importance of hospital decongestion, which may result in patients
    with certain illnesses and injuries gaining more priority over road victims. It may also be worth noting for
    hospitals and governments in distributing and allocating patients, should there be multiple hospitals in the
    vicinity.
</p>
<p>
    Several features and data prediction techniques were not touched upon by the researchers. Further studies and work
    may be directed towards the effect of hospital proximity and distance from each other, as well as the distance from
    the road event to the hospital. More advanced models such as neural networks may also be used for a more in-depth
    and possibly more accurate prediction. Some features and terms including "hospital capacity" could also be separated
    into multiple features and therefore defined better.
</p>
<p>
    Notably, the researchers conclude that, based from the model, "hospital capacity" (for tending after road crash
    victims) does not significantly rely on the availability of hospital staff. Perhaps more data is required to
    determine if this were true or not, as it seems counter-intuitive that more room for patients would not need more
    staff tending to their needs.
